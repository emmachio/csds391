The file Chio_Emma_HW9_files contains the functions that were required for homework 1.
The methods below correspond to their respective number:
1a: originalData()
1b: oneLayerNN()
1c: decisionBoundary(weights)
1d: threeDPlotting()
1e: examples() and classifier()

2a: error()
2c: gradient()

3a: optimizeGradient()
3b: showoptimization()

*While running the code I found that the convergence value had to be changed to avoid the computer from crashing due to too many requests,
if this is the case, please reduce the convergence value so that it will run the program less.
